# Solution: the Gaussian Free Field satisfies the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms

Solution counterpart of `Challenge.lean`: it re-declares the Challenge definitions verbatim
and proves the challenge theorem from the OSforGFF library — the witness is the library's
Minlos-constructed measure `gaussianFreeField_free` under the canonical proper-time propagator
`GFFPropagator.ofProperTime`, its characterization is `gff_real_characteristic`, and the five
OS axioms are the fields of the dimension-generic master theorem
`gaussianFreeField_satisfies_all_OS_axioms_generic`; the four pullback-existence clauses and
the characterised OS1 integrability, OS2, OS3, and OS4 are discharged through the library's
constructed Schwartz-map transforms (`QFT.euclidean_action`, the `Star` instance,
`TimeTranslation.timeTranslationSchwartzCLM`, and `SchwartzMap.translate`).

The Challenge (restated below) covers, in Mathlib-only terms, the construction of Euclidean
quantum field theory's
simplest, interaction-free model: for every spacetime dimension `d ≥ 2` and mass `m > 0`, the
free (massive) **Gaussian Free Field** exists as a probability measure on the tempered
distributions `S'(ℝ^d)` and satisfies all five **Osterwalder–Schrader axioms** — OS0
(analyticity), OS1 (regularity), OS2 (Euclidean invariance), OS3 (reflection positivity), and
OS4 (clustering and ergodicity). By the Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction theorem, these
axioms are precisely the conditions under which a Euclidean field theory defines a relativistic
quantum field theory satisfying the Wightman axioms.

The measure is pinned down uniquely by the characterization clause of the theorem: its
generating functional is the Gaussian `Z[f] = exp (−½ ⟨f, C f⟩)`, where `C = (−Δ + m²)⁻¹` is
the free covariance, presented here by its proper-time (heat-kernel) integral
`C(x, y) = ∫₀^∞ e^{−t m²} (4πt)^{−d/2} e^{−‖x−y‖²/(4t)} dt` — an elementary closed formula
requiring no operator theory. Without this clause the existence statement would be trivial
(the Dirac measure at `0` satisfies all five axioms); with it, the theorem asserts exactly
that *the free field* satisfies them.

All definitions below are self-contained over Mathlib: the field configuration space and its
cylinder σ-algebra, the generating functionals, the free covariance, the Schwinger functions
and the mollifier bumps, time reflection, the positive-time half-space, time shifts, and the
five OS axiom predicates.

Euclidean invariance (OS2), the OS star of reflection positivity (OS3), the mollifier
smearing of the two-point function (OS1), and the translations of clustering and of the
ergodic time average (OS4) are stated by *characterising* the relevant transformed test
functions — the pullback `f(g⁻¹x)`, the reflected conjugate `conj (f (Θx))`, the translate
`f(x − a)` — pointwise, rather than constructing them as Schwartz maps: that each transform
is again a Schwartz function is a fact of analysis, not part of the statement, so each axiom
simply quantifies over any test function with the required values, as in "for every `f'`
with `f' x = f (g⁻¹ x)`, …". Two test functions with the same values are equal, so this
states the same axiom — provided such `f'` exist at all. The four `…Exists` clauses of the
theorem (`EuclideanPullbackExists`, `TimeReflectionStarExists`, `TimeTranslationExists`,
`TranslationExists`) assert precisely that existence, so no axiom can hold vacuously.
Likewise, OS1's two-point condition quantifies its limit explicitly: the mollified
two-point functions must *converge* to some locally integrable `K`, rather than a totalized
limit operator being applied to them. The single `sorry` is the theorem to be proved.

The formulation of the axioms follows Glimm–Jaffe, *Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral
Point of View* (Springer, 1987), ch. 6, stated for probability measures on `S'(ℝ^d)`; OS3 is
the complex star formulation of Osterwalder–Schrader (*Axioms for Euclidean Green's
functions II*, Comm. Math. Phys. 42 (1975) 281–305, axiom E2).

function `K` is locally integrable. No convergence is demanded at the coincident point
`x = 0` (a Lebesgue-null set, where the two-point function of a quantum field diverges), so
`K 0` is unconstrained. The limit is quantified explicitly — the convergence of the
mollified two-point functions is part of the condition. As explained at the top of the

`‖Z[f]‖ ≤ exp (c (‖f‖₁ + ‖f‖ₚᵖ))` for some `1 ≤ p ≤ 2` and `c > 0`; when `p = 2`, the

/-- **OS2 (Euclidean invariance):** the generating functional is invariant under every
Euclidean motion `x ↦ R x + b` of `ℝ^d`.

The motion acts on test functions by pullback, `(g · f)(x) = f (g⁻¹ x) = f (R⁻¹ (x − b))`.
As explained at the top of the file, the pullback is characterised pointwise: the axiom
quantifies over any test function `f'` with `f' x = f (R⁻¹ (x − b))`, and the theorem's

/-- **OS3 (Reflection positivity):** the generating functional defines a positive
semi-definite Hermitian form on test functions supported at positive time. This is the
complex (star) formulation of Osterwalder–Schrader (1975, axiom E2): for all complex test
functions `f₁, …, fₙ` supported in the positive-time half-space and coefficients
`c₁, …, cₙ ∈ ℂ`, `∑ᵢⱼ c̄ᵢ cⱼ Z[fᵢ − fⱼ*] ≥ 0`, where `(f*)(x) = conj (f (Θ x))` combines
time reflection with complex conjugation.

The support restriction is a plain hypothesis, `tsupport (f i) ⊆ positiveTimeSet`. As
explained at the top of the file, the star is characterised pointwise: the axiom quantifies
over any test functions `fstar j` with `fstar j x = conj (f j (Θ x))`, and the theorem's
`TimeReflectionStarExists` clause guarantees they exist. -/

`Z[f + T_a g] → Z[f] Z[g]` as the translation `‖a‖ → ∞`, so that widely separated test
functions become statistically independent. As explained at the top of the file, the
translate `(T_a g)(x) = g(x − a)` is characterised pointwise by the quantified `g'`; the
theorem's `TranslationExists` clause guarantees it exists. -/

`(1/T) ∫₀ᵀ A(T_s ω) ds` converges to the expectation `𝔼_μ[A]` in `L²(μ)` as `T → ∞`.

The translated distribution acts by `⟨T_s ω, g⟩ = ⟨ω, g ∘ timeShift (−s)⟩`. As explained at
the top of the file, the time translate is characterised pointwise by the quantified family
`translate`, and the translated observable is written through the real/imaginary

/-- **The Gaussian Free Field satisfies the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms, in every dimension
`d ≥ 2`.** For every mass `m > 0` there is a probability measure `μ` on the tempered
distributions `S'(ℝ^d)` — the free (massive) Gaussian Free Field — such that:

* `μ` is uniquely characterized by its generating functional
  `Z[f] = exp (−½ ⟨f, C f⟩)`, where `C = (−Δ + m²)⁻¹` is the free covariance in its
  proper-time form (this clause pins `μ` down: a Gaussian measure is determined by its
  characteristic functional);
* every Euclidean motion pulls test functions back to test functions
  (`EuclideanPullbackExists`), every test function has an Osterwalder–Schrader star
  (`TimeReflectionStarExists`), and time translation and spacetime translation carry test
  functions to test functions (`TimeTranslationExists`, `TranslationExists`), so none of
  the axioms below holds vacuously; and
* `μ` satisfies the five Osterwalder–Schrader axioms: OS0 (analyticity), OS1 (regularity),
  OS2 (Euclidean invariance), OS3 (reflection positivity, complex star formulation), and
  OS4 (both clustering and ergodicity).

The dimension hypothesis `2 ≤ d` enters through the time/space split used by OS3 and is
carried as a `Fact` instance so the positive-time apparatus can consume it. -/
